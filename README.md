> Many parts of the world have not been mapped or in many cases maps are outdated by disaster or conflict. \
> Having detailed maps of areas with a high risk of natural disasters is fundamental to facilitate the prompt response of emergency responders. \
> Nowadays when new maps are needed they are drawn by hand, often by volunteers who participate in the so-called “Mapathons”. \
> Machine Learning and AI can help drawing accurate maps.
